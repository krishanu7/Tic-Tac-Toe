# Tic Tac Toe Game using ReactJS
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using ReactJS. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 board, with the goal of getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins, or if all spaces on the board are filled and neither player has won.

You can play the game by going to the following URL in your web browser: https://tic-tac-toe-by-krishanu.netlify.app/
## Getting Started
To start playing the game, simply click on an empty space on the board to mark it with your player symbol (either "X" or "O"). The game will automatically switch turns between players until the game ends.

If a player wins the game, the winning line of spaces will be highlighted and a message will be displayed showing which player won. If the game ends in a tie, a message will be displayed indicating that the game is a draw.
